This project uses Maven for managing dependencies.

You should have **Eclipse Luna** with the plugins:
- m2e (included in the Java Developers edition)
- ObjectAid (http://www.objectaid.com/installation)

Once you have all this dependencies and have imported the project into your workspace you can open `model.ucls` and review the UML diagram.
